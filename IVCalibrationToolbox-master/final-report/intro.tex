\section{Introduction}

In this project, we estimate the calibration (relative rotation and translation) between a rigidly connected camera and IMU using an unscented Kalman filter. Calibrating a camera-IMU setup is the first step in sensor fusion research. Our filter and motion simulator are the first steps in creating an open-source calibration toolbox for sensor fusion enthusiasts. 

The state vector in our unscented Kalman filter (UKF) consists of the camera-to-IMU rotation and translation, as well as the orientation and position of the IMU in the world coordinate system, the velocity in world space, the gravity vector, and the biases of the IMU's accelerometer and the gyroscope. The IMU-camera setup moves in the world space, and the camera images a set of world points with known locations in the world space. The imaged points form the measurement in our system. We predict the next state of the system from the current state by propagating a set of sigma points and noisy inertial measurements through the process model. We correct the state whenever a measurement is obtained from the camera. We synthesize the data used in this project, and we report results from the unscented Kalman filter on the noisy synthesized data.
